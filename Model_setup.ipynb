    "1. Fundemental Model: Quarterly Data using Financial Statements { symbolized by F}\n",
    "2. Correlation Model: Daily Data using Prices and Indicies {symbolized by Q}"

    "\n",
    "I will be building datasets for the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Price Data {Q} : Daily Prices (get Earnings Annoucments dates from FMP and prices for day, week and month after from another source where prices are available __[requires two steps]__)\n",
    "- [X] Financial Statement Data {F} : Quarterly Statments and Earnings\n",
    "- [X] Earnings Data {F} : Earnings per share currrent and forecast (quarterly or trailing 12months)\n",
    "- [X] Company Specific Information {F} : Information describing the Company\n",
    "- [ ] Market Indicies {QF} : Index data of major exchnages \n",
    "- [ ] Economic Factors {QF} : Treasury yields, commodity prices, gold, unemployment, GDP releases\n",
    "- [ ] Exchange Structure {QF} : Volumes over time, also can be combined volume during time or average volumes\n",
    "- [X] Ratios/Specialized KPI {QF}: Financial statement ratios or created ratios such a Piotrowski Score\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to support data creation, I will also need to create datasets or dictionaries with the following info:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] S&P and Nasdaq members and symbols\n",
    "- [x] Industry labels for classyfing stocks into industries \n",
    "- [x] Dates and quarters labels\n",

    "- Time Frame: 5 years\n",
    "- Frequency: Daily and Quarterly\n",

    "- Check for Missing Values\n",
    "- Check for Duplicates\n",
    "- Check for Outliers\n",

    "1. Every column is a variable.\n",
    "2. Every row is an observation.\n",
    "3. Every cell is a single value.\n",
